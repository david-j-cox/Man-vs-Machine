# Background
The purpose of science is to predict and control the subject matter under investigation. For behavior science, the subject matter is behavior. For nearly 100 years, behavior analysts have developed quantitative models that allow us to predict and control organismic behavior. But, over the past 10-20 years, advances in technology alongside computational models have increased the ability to employ sophisticated machine learning techniques behavioral data. Coincidentally, the goal is often also to predict and control human behavior. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare the predictive ability of models when the models are: solely based on past models from operant choice research, solely based on machine learning, and a combination of both behavior analytic and machine learning models.

# Data
Data for one project were obtained from the Kaggle MLB Pitch Data 2015-2018 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018/). 
Data for a second project were obtained from MLB's baseball savant.
